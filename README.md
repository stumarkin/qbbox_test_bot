Its a Telegram Webapp bot for QBbox - the warehouse for storing personal belongings. Previously they had a bot, that was a proxy betwen customer and a support-guy just for performing human replies (not automated). 

I have made for them the bot app where customer can:
- specify the stuff to give away to warehouse, its quantity, and get the price for the service
- choose the period and get the discounted price for the 6 an 12 month periods
- send the application with the chosen params
